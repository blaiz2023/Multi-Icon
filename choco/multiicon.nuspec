    <description>Create stunning, high quality (256 x 256) multi-resolution icons (.ico) and "mainicon" resources (.res) with ease and reliability.  Open an image from file, or paste one in with transparency, or drag and drop an image directly onto the corresponding icon resolutions, then save.

![Multi Icon v1.0.2022 Screenshot](https://rawcdn.githack.com/blaiz2023/Multi-Icon/81e3ed41fe52e2b1de18e0fe7cc4341375d4d509/images/multiicon-screenshot.jpg)

The multi-resolution icon stores a 256 x 256 image in PNG format, and five images at 64 x 64, 48 x 48, 32 x 32, 24 x 24 and 16 x 16 in native Windows icon format for maximum compatibility, back to Windows 95.

Use a single Master image for the complete set of images, or separately individualise each image resolution for complete control over appearance.  Support for 32 bit images with 8 bit alpha mask, and built-in common mask shapes to instantly transform a basic, square image into an alpha-transparent shape with one click.

Save as a multi-resolution icon in either the standard Windows icon (.ico) format, or as a Windows resource (.res) in the "mainicon" format for direct inclusion in an app, as the app's icon.
